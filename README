Changes Made to Modpcrtm 

Commit #3 changes:
Changed compilor from ifort to mpif90 (see Makefile)
Got rid of second compilation in /test/ folder and hence executable can be run after compilation e.g. make
Changed Modtrn.f to call subroutine that runs driver in parallel. 

Commit #1 and #2 Changes:
Parallelized code by modifying driver and other subroutines to take in thread numbers as arguements
Linked object files into library
Created Fortran Test Script in/test/multicall.F90
Created build script that cleans objects, makes modpcrtm, links libraries, and compiles test script
Added a subroutine to remove unnecessary files e.g. /src/rmfil.f
