To submit a job:

   "qsub gnu_test_exe_list_ha.csh"

which will produce

   gnu_test_exe_list_ha.csh.e??????.1  (where ?????? represents the qsub job number)
   gnu_test_exe_list_ha.csh.o??????.1

In this case, we are processing 135 FOVs in one PCRTM run.

Then run post-processor in the Matlab environment:

   "radtorefl" 


Updates made in src directory:

   Adapted to handle land or ocean FOVs, process multiple FOVs per run.  
   Write radiance output files from driver and include solar zenith angle.

   Files changed:
   dgrd.f
   driver.f
   fnames.f
   rflect.f
   trans.f
   pcrtm.in

Scripts added:
 
   gnu_test_exe_list_ha.csh
   myscript_list_testexe.csh

Input file added:

   list_tape5_?.asc - Provides a list of tape5 input filenames to allow the 
                      modPCRTM to run multiple FOVs per run. Also has an index
		      showing how many FOVs are processed in this run.
